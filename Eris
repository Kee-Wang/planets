If we have one for pluto, we should have one for the other dwarf planets.

Eris is named after the Greek goddess of strife and discord.
It's a little more massive than Pluto, and it's also the largest body
orbiting the Sun that we haven't sent a spacecraft to.

Hopefully it's not mad at us for not visiting.

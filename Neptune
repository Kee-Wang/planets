Neptune 14 moons: Triton

Io is the innermost and the second smallest of the four Galilean moons. It was
discovered, along with Europa, Ganymede and Callisto by Galileo...

Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. It was probably named for the same
Roman demigod referenced in the Disney version of The Little Mermaid.
